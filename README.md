# tova-test

The TOVA test that involves counting dots is a version of the visual TOVA.

In this test, participants are typically shown a series of images with a varying number of dots, and they are required to respond when they see a specific number of dots. The test measures the participant's ability to sustain attention and respond accurately and quickly.

This version of the TOVA is used to assess visual attention and can be helpful in diagnosing attention-related disorders like ADHD.
